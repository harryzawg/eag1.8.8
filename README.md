## Setup Guide
First of all, you have to fork this project so you're able to use Codespaces.  
Fork the repo, and once it's forked, at the top of the page go into Code, and select Codespaces in the other tab.  
Proceed until the url changes to a series of random letters and numbers. (should look something like this refactored-halibut-7vr9xvq9g5gvhw5p7.github.dev)  
Once you're in, look below the main window until you see Terminal. Click on it.  
At the right of the Terminal window, click + until you see 2 Bash tabs.  
Paste this into the first tab: `cd server && sudo java -jar server.jar` and this into the second tab: `cd bungee && sudo java -jar bungee.jar`  
Now, beside Terminal in the bottom, there should be a Ports section. Open it and click "Forward a Port" and forward the port 8081.   
Once you do that, click on "Add Port" and forward 25565.  
Make sure to make the ports public, to do this Right click, and go to Port Visibility and set it to Public.  
Now, copy the link for port 8081 and paste it into eaglercraft with wss:// at the start (get rid of https:// as well!)  
and you're done! that should be it.
Enjoy
